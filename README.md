Numble is a simple game of Math and Logic. You are given the sum of the digits and have to guess the number.

Once you guess the correct number, you can level up or repeat the same level. It is easy to share your results.

The sum of the digits remains the same for all 5 levels and everyone is guessing the same sum per day. But the numbers you use are unique to your attempt - if you were to repeat the level, you would end up guessing a different number that adds up to the same sum. So you can play multiple times, challenging yourself to find new combinations with every attempt.
